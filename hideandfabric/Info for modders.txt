If you want to use the functionality provided by Hide and Fabric's wool shearing library then have a look at 
the patches contained in the file assets/hideandfabric/patches/sheep.json, all you need to do to add wool growth
and shearing behaviour to your entity is to add the "wool" entity behaviour to both theserver and client side
behavior arrays and adjust the properties to your liking, what the entity behavior does is allow you to define
a wool/hair item that you can shear depending on what generation the animal is and you can customise the behavior
to allow you to define what the minimum generation of the animal that you can begin shearing them at, the minimum
and maximum of the random roll that determines the amount of the shearing product you get per shearing, how much
extra product you get from using shears instead of a knife (this can be zero), how long you have to wait in between 
shearings for the product to regrow, what sound is played when shearing is performed and how often the animal is 
scratched and a small amount of damage is dealt to the animal during shearing (this can result in the animal attacking)

Here is a rundown on what the various properties do:

- minQuantity is the lower bound of the random roll determining how much product is received during shearing, if
this value is undefined the default value is 4
- maxQuantity is the upper bound of the random roll determining how much product is received, the maximum amount 
is equal to maxQuantity + shearBonus + 1, if this value is undefined the default value is 12
- shearableAt is the number of in-game hours that you have to wait after shearing before you can shear the animal again,
if this value is undefined the default value is 216 hours or 9 days
- minGen is the minimum generation number at which you can begin to shear the animal for it's shearing products,
below this number the animal is considered too wild to be sheared, is this is undefined the default value is gen 3
- shearsBonus is the amount of extra wool you receive during shearing for using a pair of shears instead of a knife,
or the amount of potential wool you lose out on when shearing with a knife, if undefined the default value is 4
- scratchChance is the chance threshold in a random roll between 0 and 1 below which a small amount of damage is dealt
to the animal during shearing to simulate accidental nicking of the animal, using a knife doubles this chance, if this
value is undefined the default value is 0.5
- woolItem is the item code of the item given when the animal is sheared, by default this value is "hideandfabric:woolfibers"
- shearSound is the asset code for the sound produced when shearing the animal, if undefined the default value of this
property is "game:sound/player/scrape.ogg" which is the same sound used in the vanilla game for harvesting/skinning animals

Here is an example definition, make sure it is defined in both the client and server side behaviors array and that the values
in both definitions are the same:
   {
      "code": "wool",

      "minQuantity": 16,

      "maxQuantity": 32,

      "shearableAt": 96,

      "minGen": 2,

      "shearsBonus": 8,
      "scratchChance": 0.5,

      "woolItem": "game:flaxfibers",
      "shearSound": "game:sounds/player/scrape.ogg"
   }
