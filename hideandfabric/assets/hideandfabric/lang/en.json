Use a <a href=\"handbook://block-trough-genericwood-small-ns\">small trough</a> (filled with grain) for chickens and a <a href=\"handbook://block-trough-genericwood-large-head-north\">large trough</a> (filled with grain or dry grass or vegetables) for boars and sheep. Feeding male and female animals will also make them produce offspring and prevent them from losing weight during winter.<br><br>Ewes can be milked to <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-cheese\">produce cheese</a>, and both rams and ewes can be <a href=\"handbook://hideandfabric:gamemechanicinfo-animalshearing\">sheared to produce wool</a>.<br><br><strong>Rearing poultry</strong><br>Poultry (chickens) lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.  The eggs must be incubated for several days to hatch.  Place a <a href=\"handbook://block-henbox-empty\">Henbox</a> to provide your chickens with a place to lay eggs and sit on them.  Also requires a rooster to fertilize them eggs!  If there are not enough henboxes, chickens will lay eggs on the ground which will not hatch.<br><br><strong>Domestication</strong><br>Animals bred this way, will, over several generations, lose their fear and aggressiveness towards the player. After the 3rd generation you can also instantly kill them with a <a href=\"handbook://item-cleaver-copper\">cleaver</a>.<br><br><strong>Beekeeping</strong><br>In order to obtain wax and honey, you will need to build <a href=\"handbook://block-skep-empty-east\">skeps</a> into which wild bees like to swarm. Be sure to place some flowers around. You can move a populated skep inside a free backpack slot by right clicking it. Carry it to the desired location and use CTRL+Scroll wheel to select that backpack slot, to place the skep back down again. Your bees will visit nearby flowers and slowly produce honey, a richly populated skep can also in turn swarm to start a new bee colony in a nearby empty skep. When your skep colony is mature, break it to remove the <a href=\"handbook://item-honeycomb\">honeycomb</a>, note that this is quite likely to anger the bees. Angry bees can become diverted if there happens to be anything nearby which <a href=\"handbook://item-strawdummy\">looks similar</a>. Squeeze the honeycomb over a bucket to extract the honey, leaving wax. Honey can be taken from the bucket into individual bowls.",
