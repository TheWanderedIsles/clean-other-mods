with all other "transforming" recipes that use a saw.

# v0.0.1 - 2021-03-21 - First Bricks Thrown

## New Features

### Block transformations

* Saw cobble, stonebrick and claybrick blocks into slabs
* Combine cobble slabs with clay into full cobble blocks
* Combine two clay or stone brick slabs with mortar into full brick blocks
* Combine two stonepath slabs into stonepath blocks
* Combine three stonepath slabs into stonepath stairs
* You can craft chimneys also with mortar (to be consistent with other brick blocks)
* You can craft brick stairs consistent to cobble stairs (edge on the top-left corner)

### Recycling

* Use a hammer or pickaxe to break down cobble blocks or slabs into rocks
* Use a saw to saw clay or stone brick blocks, slabs, stairs or chimneys back into bricks
* Use a shovel to break stonepath blocks or stairs back into stonepath slabs

#### Note:

The vanilla clay brick blocks, slabs, stairs and chimneys have yields inconsistent with f.i. cobble stairs.
In addition, brick slabs need 5 bricks, compared to cobble slabs which only need 3 stones.
Thus the recycling of the various brick blocks yields different brick counts than recycling rock based blocks.

**This version does not touch the vanilla recipes, but it is planned to adjust the brick recipes
to be consistent with the cobble variants.**
